  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Claude Code itself is not installed by this formula:
        https://docs.claude.com/claude-code

      Register a workspace and start its server:
        crc add work --repo git@github.com:you/work.git

      To start servers at boot and restart them if they die (asks for sudo):
        crc supervise install

      Config lives in ~/.crc; logs in ~/Library/Logs/claude-remote-control.
      Before uninstalling, run: crc supervise uninstall
    EOS

    ENV["CRC_HOME"] = testpath/"crc"
    assert_match "no servers registered", shell_output("#{bin}/crc list")
